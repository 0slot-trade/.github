### Quickstart: `staked_conn`

The `staked_conn` interface is similar to the RPC interface, primarily providing the `sendTransaction` method, which directly connects to our validator node.

#### When calling the `sendTransaction` method of `staked_conn`, please note:
- A maximum of **5 calls per second** is allowed.
- You need to transfer an amount **greater than or equal to 0.0001 SOL** to one of the following accounts:
  - `6fQaVhYZA4w3MBSXjJ81Vf6W1EDYeUPXpgVQ6UQyU1Av` (0slot_dot_trade.sol)
  - `4HiwLEP2Bzqj3hM2ENxJuzhcPCdsafwiet3oGkMkuQY4`
  - `7toBU3inhmrARGngC7z6SjyP85HgGMmCTEwGNRAcYnEK`
  - `8mR3wB1nh4D6J9RUCugxUpc6ya8w38LPxZ3ZjcBhgzws`
  - `6SiVU5WEwqfFapRuYCndomztEwDjvS5xgtEof3PLEGm9`
  - `TpdxgNJBWZRL8UXF5mrEsyWxDWx9HQexA9P1eTWQ42p`
  - `D8f3WkQu6dCF33cZxuAsrKHrGsqGP2yvAHf8mX6RXnwf`
  - `GQPFicsy3P3NXxB5piJohoxACqTvWE9fKpLgdsMduoHE`
  - `Ey2JEr8hDkgN8qKJGrLf2yFjRhW7rab99HVxwi5rcvJE`
  - `4iUgjMT8q2hNZnLuhpqZ1QtiV8deFPy2ajvvjEpKKgsS`
  - `3Rz8uD83QsU8wKvZbgWAPvCNDU6Fy8TSZTMcPm3RB6zt`

#### Example for `cmd: curl`:
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://ny.0slot.trade?api-key=$TOKEN' \
-d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": $UUID,
    "method": "sendTransaction",
    "params": [ 
        "",
        { "encoding": "base64" }
    ] 
}'
```

#### For better performance and faster speeds, you can test and select the most suitable IP to use:
- **NY**: `ny.0slot.trade`
